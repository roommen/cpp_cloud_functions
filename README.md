My potential talk at GDG DevFest, Bangalore
<br/><br/>
Exploration of Google Cloud Functions on how C and C++ code could be run, by compiling to Nodejs libraries and having it imported.<br/>
Look at the existing repo (for AWS) and have the changes included for C along with custom tweaks required from AWS Lambda to GCF for C++.

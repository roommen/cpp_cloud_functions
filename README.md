<br/>
Set of various sample programs that imports a custom node module compiled from C++ code. This repo contains sample progs like just printing out a value after taking it as an event argument and another prog that takes a single argument (string or int) to produce a processed output.

README files exist under each folder to see the exact functionality in detail.
